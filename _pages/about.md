Welcome! This is a portfolio site created to showcase social science research and data visualization projects I have worked on. I am currently a data product management fellow with the NYC Mayor's Office of Economic Opportunity until August 2025. I have approximately 5 years of work experience in the non-profit and academic research and public sector. I use econometric, geospatial, and data visualization tools to investigate topics in public policy while incorporating ethnographic methods. Click on the tabs above to explore publications, projects, and organizations I have been a part of.
