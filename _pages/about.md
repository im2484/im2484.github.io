Welcome! This is a portfolio site created to showcase social science research and data visualization projects I have worked on. I am currently a research assistant with the VizE Lab for Ethnographic Data Visualization at Princeton University until May 2025. I have approximately 5 years of work experience in the non-profit and academic research sectors and currently work at the intersection of anthropology and data science - I use econometric, geospatial, and data visualization tools to investigate topics in public policy. Click on the tabs above to explore publications, projects, and organizations I have been a part of.
