As part of my work at the VizE Lab I assisted Professor Keith Hollingsworth with an economic analysis of the 1908 Atlanta Race Riots and its effects on black businesses. I scraped business directory data from the Atlanta Historical Archives and cleaned this data to form a dataset that could be used for geospatial and statistical analysis. All work was conducted in RStudio.
